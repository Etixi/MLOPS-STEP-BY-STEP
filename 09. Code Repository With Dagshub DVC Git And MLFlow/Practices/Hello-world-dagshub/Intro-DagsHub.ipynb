By following this notebook, you will create your first 'hello-world' project on DagsHub. We will see how to <u>configure Git and DVC</u> and use them to <u>track code and data files</u>. Then, we will define DagsHub as the remote storage and <u>push DVC's tracked files</u> to it. Lastly, you will create our first <u>Data Science Experiment on DagsHub</u>.\n","<br>\n","\n","**The project** - In this walkthrough, we will train a model to classify 'Ham' and 'Spam' emails. We will use the Enron dataset that stores labeled email in a CSV file.\n","\n","\n","<a href=\"https://dagshub.com/user/sign_up?redirect_to=\" title=\"DAGsHub Sign Up\"><img
